# Get Progressive with it

**_Note [Jan 5, 2020]:_** Update after a practice run of the workshop I am making a slight change
to the requirements. Changing the DB system from Postgres to SQLite. I am finishing up cleanup for
that test, but all expectd requirement should be included here.

**_Note: I am working on cleaning up the backend and client apps for this workshop, but they are
orthagonal to the code we will be working on. Please check back soon for updates._**

We will be turning a relatively simple Todo application into a fully featured Progressive Web
Aoolication(PWA). The majority of our code will be working on developing a Service Worker capable of
supporting the application.
