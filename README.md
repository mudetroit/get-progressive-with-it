# Get Progressive with it

__*Note: I am working on cleaning up the backend and client apps for this workshop, but they are
orthagonal to the code we will be working on. Please check back soon for updates.*__

We will be turning a relatively simple  Todo application into a fully featured Progressive Web
Aoolication(PWA). The majority of our code will be working on developing a Service Worker capable of
supporting the application.
