# Get Progressive with it

We will be turning a relatively simple Todo application into a fully featured Progressive Web
Aoolication(PWA). The majority of our code will be working on developing a Service Worker capable of
supporting the application.

**_Note: I will still make a few small changes to address some problems I have seen in testing, but they should require a simple git pull to bring in._**
